# Literature Review and Critique

The purpose of the literature critique is to help you get into the right frame of mind to read, think about, and write about research literature. This is mainly a critical thinking and communication exercise.

If you are working with me, I will have helped you to select at least two pieces of research literature that reflect your topic area. <!-- Your job is to build a 3-4 page critique about these two pieces of literature. -->

If you have not received at least two pieces of related literature from your supervisor, ask for him/her for it! You need something to get started.

## Deliverables

You will create two deliverables for this part of CPSC 502:

1. 3-Related Work Slides
1. Related work prose

The **3-related work slides** are exactly that. Deliver a short slidedeck of three slides, where each slide contains information about a piece of related literature. In four or so bullet points for each slide, identify: (a) what is the problem this work tackles? (b) what is the approach that they take? (c) how do they evaluate their approach? (d) how does this relate to your own project (i.e. what lessons can we learn to avoid, or what lessons can we learn that will be useful)? (e) what are some strengths of this work (optional)? (f) what are some weaknesses of this work?

The **prose** deliverable should be based on your 3-related work slides. It is typically 2-4 pages in length. Take the related work slides that you have, and develop each of these into a set of paragraphs (probably about three paragraphs per paper). For each piece of related work: (a) provide the citation information; (b) provide a paragraph that summarizes the problem, approach and evaluation in a piece of work (in lieu of evaluation, you might discuss what its major findings were); (c) describe in depth how this relates to your work (i.e. what lessons can we learn to avoid; what lessons can we learn that will be useful), and then (d) identify strengths and weaknesses of the work (i.e. what would you do differently if you were doing this piece of work; what would you ask the authors?). Finally, put together a _synthesis_ section/paragraph, where you identify how the three pieces of related work are related to one another, and what you learn from them as a whole.

## HOWTO: Read related literature

Reading related work can be challenging, because typically it introduces a lot of vocabulary that you aren't familiar with, and because often, it relies on your knowing a lot about the area when you might actually not know anything yet. The frustration (and perhaps boredom) that you feel is normal. The key is having an understanding of why you are doing it so that you are reading carefully for the right bits of information. The cool thing is that once you've acquired a good sense of the literature, you'll breeze through new pieces of work much faster, and you'll feel smart because things begin to fit together.

I have a three-step approach to approaching each piece of related literature that I recommend students take. It prevents you from getting too glassy-eyed when reading literature.

1. **Step 1: Critical read, and annotation strategy.** Skim, read, and read again.
1. **Step 2: Think.** WTF is going on here.
1. **Step 3: Write.** As bullet points first.

### Step 1: Critical read, and annotation strategy

The first time you read the paper, read the abstract, then the introduction, then the conclusion. Based on these points, using a sticky note, indicate in bullet point form, what you think the paper is about, and what arguments the authors are making. Attach this sticky note to the front of your paper.

Next, read the paper from front to back. On the first pass, try to understand what the authors are saying -- understand what they did, and pick out arguments about why they did what they did, and also what they are claiming about their approach (why it's good, etc.). Also look for details on their experiment or evaluation, and think about whether you think that approach/experiment is good based on what you know.

Now that you know what is in the paper, go back to your first sticky note and check whether the authors actually did what they said they would do. Did they actually address everything they said they would address? Sometimes, I now annotate my sticky note with "AHA! They didn't do this!" and snarky comments to myself like that.

Read through the paper now from front to back again. Identify each argument the authors are making, and make a decision as to whether they are actually doing a good job of supporting each of their arguments. In this pass, choose one of the following frameworks, and identify each of the following points in the framework:

|Framework 1|Framework 2|
|---|---|
|**Problem:** What is the problem the authors are addressing in their paper? What is their motivation for tackling this problem (i.e. who will care)?<br/>**Approach:** What is the approach the authors are taking in this paper to address the problem? That is, if they have a solution what is the solution?<br/>**Evaluation:** How do they authors evaluate their approach? How do they know it is a good one?<br/>**Contribution:** What do the authors contribute to the body of knowledge/research that already exists?|**Question:** What is the single (big) research question the authors are trying to address in this work? Why do they care about this question?<br/>**Approach:** How do the authors address this question? How do they operationalize this question within the framework of their research? If they conducted an experiment/study to address this question, what was it?<br/>**Findings:** Whare the main findings that the authors discover/identify from their research?<br/>**Contribution:** How do the authors' findings address the original question? What more do we know that we didn't earlier? Further, what questions does their findings raise within the broader research frame? |

### Step 2: Think

Consider carefully why we chose this paper. Identify the following:

* How does it relate to the topic that you have chosen for your work?
* What mistakes did the authors make that we can learn from?
* What major findings did the authors make that we can leverage for the purpose of our work?

### Step 3: Write

Once you have that information together, it is time to sketch this stuff out in bullet-point form.

**Citation.** Provide the full citation for the paper.

**Summarize.** For 4-6 sentences, summarize the paper using the framework that you used in Step 1.

**Rationale.** What is the relationship between this work and your project? Why did you choose this work?

**Strengths.** In bullet point form, identify the strengths of the paper, and also why it is a strength (is it how they did the work, is it unusually novel, etc.). Articulate here arguments that the authors make that they really do a good job backing up.

**Weaknesses.** In bullet point form, identify the weaknesses of the paper, and why it is a weakness. What identify why (from a high level) it is a weakness, and also suggest an alternate approach.

**Questions for author.** This last section, you should imagine that you have the opportunity to talk to the original authors. If this were the case, what would you ask them about their work? (e.g. "Why did you do X instead of Y?")

**What can we learn?** Given that you've identified strengths and weaknesses, and also talked about how this work relates to your own now, identify what you can do to build on this work in your own. What lessons can you take? What can you do differently, etc.?

<!--
If you would like feedback on what you have done, address each of these points initially in bullet point form.

Once you have received my feedback, I encourage you to roll this into prose (as that's what's expected for your submission).
