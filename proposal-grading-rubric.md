# Tentative Proposal Grading Rubric

Notice that some of these components are mainly related to your (R)esearch, while several components are related to your (C)ommunication skills. Your grade will be computed by summing your score for each category, and normalizing based on the relative weighting of each category based on your course.

Component | Poor | Satisfactory | Good | Outstanding
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Articulation of problem and motivation (50% R / 50% C) | Poorly well-defined/understandable; poor delivery | Good foundation, but focus is too wide | Well-defined focus, and justified | Well-defined, clear, easy to understand
Treatment of prior work (R) | No related work | "Laudry list" of related/prior work (no synthesis) | Articulates benefits/drawbacks from prior work as it relates to current work | Synthesis is clear, and shows how current approach fits into prior work
Approach / Solution / Timetable (75% R / 25% C) | Poorly articulated; timetable is unrealistic | Approach has likely weaknesses or is unclear | Approach addresses problem, supports choice of solution; timetable has appropriate phases and makes reasonable time estimates | Approach is novel and builds on new ideas; timetable is complete and detailed; risk is managed
Clarity (C) | Tony has a hard time following | Tony *generally* gets what you are going to do | Tony *really* gets what you are trying to do | Tony *totally* gets what you are trying to do
Professionalism of presentation and writing (C) | Template is not used; writing is casual and informal | Template is used, but poorly; writing may generally be okay | Template is used well, with no deviations from the reference; writing is formal | Looks like a real academic paper
