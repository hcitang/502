# Granting Agency Activity

You have now seen lots of different elevator pitches. You have also done your own elevator pitch several times. It's time to really make them count.

One question that I have received several times is: "Why do you keep making us do the same thing over and over?" My response has been that if you are using the same elevator pitch over and over, you're doing it wrong. The idea of having multiple opportunities to do elevator pitches is to revisit and revise that elevator pitch to make it sing. With this activity, we'll put it to the test.

The basic idea is that you will each operate as a small granting agency for research. You are responsible for allocating a fixed amount of funding dollars to research that is being conducted by your classmates (reward is based on quality of an elevator pitch). Along the way, you will self-assess, and provide (potentially harsh) feedback to your classmates on how to improve their pitch.

## Learning Objectives

1. Develop critique skills for oral presentation
2. Practice oral presentation skills
3. Receive feedback on how to improve oral presentation skill
4. Self-reflection on oral presentation

## Pre-Class Activity

Prepare your pitch. Make sure that it is understandable by a relatively lay-CS audience, and that it fits within 1 minute.

Write down and print five copies of your pitch.

## Activity

### Pitch Phase
You will be placed in a small group of five people. Hand out a copy of your pitch to each person.

Within this group, you will each do your pitch to one another. (One person will track for time.) Note: you should probably not /read/ your pitch, and also, you don't need to be exact on what you had written down, but be close.

Take notes on each of the pitches.

### Dollar Allocation Phase
(Individual activity). You each have $100k to allocate between the four projects that you have seen (and your own). Perform the following three tasks:

1. Stack rank each of the pitches in terms of their quality (no ties)
2. Allocate money between each of these pitches based on their relative quality
3. Identify weaknesses in your own pitch. Articulate two-three changes that you could make to improve your own pitch.
4. For each of the remaining pitches, write one bullet point as feedback on the printed sheet they gave you.

### Roundtable Discussion
Here, you will go through each of the pitches in turn, providing feedback to one another.
