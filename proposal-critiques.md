# Proposal Critiques

Note: This will be an in-class activity. Bring a laptop.

You are responsible for critiquing two of your fellow classmates' proposals. The purpose of this exercise is to take "an outside view" of others' work. This exercise has three purposes: (1) you will provide your classmates with feedback -- this will improve their proposals; (2) you will get some feedback from your classmates -- this will improve your proposal; (3) it helps you to empathize with your external reader (me) in terms of reading stuff that is outside your area of expertise.

You will be assessed on the quality of the feedback you provide to your classmates. Remember: anyone can provide criticism -- the real trick is in providing useful, meaningful feedback that is concrete and actionable.

You will be assigned two (draft) proposals to read. Go through the proposals, using the [Proposal Grading Rubric](proposal-grading-rubric.md), giving tentative scores for each of these categories. Then, for each section of their proposal, provide at least one quality suggestion on how to improve the proposal. If you feel certain sections of the proposal can merit extra pieces of feedback, you can do so.

This feedback should be posted as a response to their proposal post on Piazza.
