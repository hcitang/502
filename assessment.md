Research is partly about the research that you actually do, and partly about your ability to communicate what you have done. The breakdown of how you are assessed reflects this split.

The below is an "in brief" version of what each component is about. More details will be available in class, along with grading rubrics.

## Proposal

3-4 page document that articulates what you will be doing for the course project. It lays out the motivation for your work, what you understand about the research space, what you will do to address the question/problem, and a timeline for your work.

## Interim Report

3-4 page document that describes all of the above, along with a more refined version of what you understand about the problem space (i.e. "related work"). You will also describe what you have done to this point to achieve your goal, and what you have left to do.

## Final Paper

5-6 page document that describes all of the above, along with what you have done (i.e. your method and results). It should also provide a reflective piece on what ought to be done next based on the work that you have done (i.e. to improve the work, or as a next step).

## Poster

A one-page (usually 3'x4') poster that visually describes your research project. You will give a 2 minute presentation in front of your poster about your work as part of a poster showcase.

## In-Class Activities

These are typically verbal activities where you are responsible for describing and/or discussing your research project. Over and over and over again. (But better each time!)

## Critiques

A crucial component of this course is assessing others' work, and receiving that feedback on your own work. I will grade the quality of your feedback, and provide you with templates to write that feedback for others.
