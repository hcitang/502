# Final Defense

A huge part of doing research is sharing and communicating the results of your work with others. We do this in two ways: through writing (which you did with your final paper), and also orally. The academic enterprise has generally chosen a "lecture plus question+answer" format to do this sort of communication. We see this in Masters and PhD defenses, as well as at conferences where researchers share their results with one another. In this component of the class, you will get to partake in this style of work.

## Format

You will have 15 uninterrupted minutes to give your presentation. Once this is complete, you will be asked to defend your work for about 10-15 minutes. This defense will occur in rounds -- I will ask you a set of questions, and then your supervisor will ask you a set of questions in a round. We will then repeat, and do a second round.

## The Presentation

Make sure to bring a well-formated and aesthetically pleasing presentation. Use this as a guide, and generally -- **do not read** your slides.

Make sure to cover the important points in your presentation: 

1. what is the problem you are solving (and why is it worth solving);
2. what is your solution;
3. what did you find, or how do you evaluate your solution, and 
4. what is the contribution of your work?

You will note that answering those four questions follows the basic flow of your paper, too. Do not be afraid to tease us early on with your work. Avoid waiting until the end to say, "TADA this is what I did!" If it takes you 10 minutes to get to what you did, then you waited too long. We want to hear about what you did by at the latest by the 5 minute mark.

## What you're supposed to do in a defense:

* Defend the choices that you made in conducting the research -- know /why/ you did what you did. Understand and identify the weaknesses of your choices, and be open to considering some of the suggestions posed by the examiners. 
* Be critical, and be ready to think and reflect on the comments that you hear. Be respectful of your examiners.
* There are some questions that examiners have an answer in their head about. In other cases, they really don't.

## Questions

To me there are three types of questions:

* [Clarification] I don't understand X. Can you explain it in further detail?
* [Justification] Explain/justify the choice of X.
* [Speculation] What would you do next on this project?

You can cross this with any of the major sections of your paper (e.g. Problem, Motivation, Approach, Implementation, Discussion, Conclusion) to get a sense for what the questions might be like. For example:

* Clarification/Problem: I don't understand how this visualization works. Can you explain it to me again?
* Justification/Approach: Why did you convert mood into an ordinal (numerical) scale? Was this the right choice to make? How could you have done it differently?
* Speculation/Problem: Would you expect this data collection to happen automatically in the future? How would the results you got differ if you'd collected a different kind of data? Is this the best type of visualization for this data? How might you change it?

## Tips

* Arrive at least 5 minutes early.
* I will have a laptop for you to present your material on, but you are free to bring your own. In any event, make sure to test your visual materials before the defense begins.
* Bring a physical copy of your final paper, as we may ask questions about the paper itself.
* A typical guide that I give my students is that you will talk for about a minute per slide. Some people go through slides quickly, but I think if you are getting to about 25+ slides, then it is probably wise to pare it down a bit.
* Make sure to cover the important points: (a) what is the problem you are solving (and why is it worth solving); (b) what is your solution; (c) what did you find, or how do you evaluate your solution, and (d) what is the contribution of your work?
* You can follow the basic outline of your paper, but remember that you want to get the point quickly. Do not dawdle too long.
* Bring water, and do not be afraid to take a sip.
* Stay calm. [Do not imagine us naked](http://womeninwetlands.blogspot.ca/2013/05/myths-about-giving-presentations.html).
* You may bring a friend (or multiple friends) to be in the audience if you like.
