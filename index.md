# CPSC 502: Research Project in Computer Science

## What is CPSC 502/503?

CPSC 502/503 are opportunities for undergraduate students to receive course credit while doing a small research project under the direct supervision of a faculty member. The project is completely up to the choosing of the faculty member (usually with some input from the student). The execution of the project typically is in close consultation (i.e. through weekly meetings) with a faculty member.

## What you need to know

This course has two major components: a research component (where you conduct actual research with your chosen supervisor), and a classroom component (where you will learn research communication skills). The research component involves defining, executing and delivering on a solid research project. The classroom component involves repeatedly speaking and writing about your research. To become really good at this, you will be involved in critiquing others' work (and receive critiques yourself).

* **Your responsibilities.** You are responsible for the grade you receive in this course. This mainly means understanding and reaching expectations -- both in terms of your research project, and in terms of the deliverables to me. If you are uncertain about expectations or things are not going well, it is your responsibility to get back on track (one way to do this is to meet with either your supervisor or me, or both). Generally, most students meet with their supervisor at least once a week. You are responsible for attending each class.
* **Your supervisor's responsibilities.** Meet with you about once a week. Help you to find an interesting research problem. Help you to figure out how to work on the problem. Provide some feedback on your written drafts (though you need to provide this to them a full week before it is due).
* **My responsibility.** Deliver content related to research communication, and facilitate in-class activities that help you to hone these skills. As a non-expert in your project area, I am doing two things: (1) reminding you that you need to be able to communicate to non-experts about your project; (2) grading you on your ability to communicate your project ideas to me, a non-expert.

## Assessment

There are several components to your grade, totaling to 100 points. These components are assessed on a mix of both written and oral communication measures.

Component| Communication | Research | Participation | *Totals*
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Proposal | 5 | 10 | | *15*
Interim Report | 5 | 10 | | *15*
Final Paper | 5 | 15 | | *20*
Final Defense | 10 | 5 | | *15*
Poster | 5 | 5 | | *10*
In-class Activities | 5 | | 5 | *10*
Critiques | 10 | | 5 | *15*
*Totals* | *45* | *45* | *10* | **100**

See the [assessment page](assessment.md) for more information on how you will be graded.

## Classroom Meetings

To facilitate in-class activities, we will meet roughly once every two weeks (though more frequently early on). These meetings will give you a chance to practice your communication and critique skills (verbal and written).

See the [schedule page](schedule.md) for when we are planning on meeting.

## Schedule

Roughly, you can think of the course as having three major phases:

Phase | What we are doing | Deliverables
--- | --- | ---
**Phase 1 (Sep - Nov)** | <ul><li>figuring out your research project</li><li>learning how to speak to non-experts about your work</li></ul> | <ul><li>proposal</li><li>related work</li></ul>
**Phase 2 (Nov-Feb)** | <ul><li>executing on research</li><li>communicating about research ideas</li></ul> | <ul><li>interim report</li><li>poster draft</li></ul>
**Phase 3 (Feb - Apr)** | <ul><li>presenting with posters</li><li>asking and responding to questions</li></ul> | <ul><li>final poster</li><li>final paper</li><li>final defense</li>

See the [schedule page](schedule.md) for more details on the schedule.

Tony Tang<br/>Office: MS 680B<br/>Email: tonyt@ucalgary<br/>Office hours: by appointment<br/>Syllabus: *forthcoming*

I am a researcher in Human-Computer Interaction. You can visit [my group's webpage](http://ricelab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca) to get a sense for my group's research. As you will see, I am likely *not* an expert in the area of your research -- actually, I likely know very little about what you are doing. But, I am *very good* at telling you whether I understand your work based on what you are writing/saying to me. 

Research is partly about the research that you actually do, and partly about your ability to communicate what you have done. Your supervisor's role is to help you with the first part (actually doing the research), and my role is to help you learn how to communicate it. (And the breakdown of how you are assessed reflects this split.) Always remember: when you are writing, you are partly writing for me -- a non-expert. Make sure I understand what you are saying.
