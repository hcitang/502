# Elevator Pitches

> "What are you working on?"

If you're doing research, this is a question you will get all the time. Your job: give a coherent response that conveys your work, and excites the person that asks. There are a million different ways to get this wrong. There is nothing worse than watching someone get bored as you are talking to them.

You want to develop at least two pitches: a 30-second pitch, and a 2-minute pitch. These pitch lengths correspond to various durations that you might get with people: 30 seconds is when you shake someone's hand while meeting them at a bar or going up an elevator; 2 minutes is when you're meeting someone who has a bit more time for you.

For this class, we will do three major activities: the first helps you nail down the content of your pitch--at its core, what do you need to say (the 30-second version); the second helps you to figure out what to say if you've got 2 minutes at your disposal, and the last one asks you to develop a visual that conveys your research alongside your 30-second pitch.

## Exercise 1: The Content

For your project, answer these questions with bullet points. The **bold phrase** is the central question that needs to be answered (the phrase immediately after that is just a reiteration of it). The *italicized questions* are follow-ups to the first questions that are important to answer, too.

1. **What is the problem?** What is the problem that you are tackling? *And, why does the problem matter? What is the context in which the problem is being felt?*
2. **What is your approach?** How are you going to solve this problem? *And, why is your approach different? Why is your approach better?*

For each of these questions, hone your bullet point responses to one sentence that answers the question.

Your elevator pitch will end up looking like this:

> Hi! My name is *Tony*, and I'm a *fourth-year* Computer Science student in CPSC *503* working with *Dr Michael Locasto.* The problem I am working on is *blah blah blah.* My approach is to *yada yada yada*.

## Exercise 2: Making it Sing

Again, consider doing bullet points for each of these, and then trying to hone the bullet points into one, maybe two sentences each. This ordering and phrasing comes from Andy Raskin (see resource below).

1. **What is the problem?** Who is the bad guy? What is the boogeyman here? Why is it makig our lives miserable? More importantly, why is it making the life of who you are talking to miserable?
2. **Why solve this problem now?** What has changed that has made this problem worth solving now? Sometimes, there is a new piece of technology at play; other times, there are new ways of solving certain kinds of problems, etc.
3. **How will the world be better?** Why is this problem worth solving? If you've solved it, what kinds of rainbows and ponies will appear?
4. **What is your approach to solving the problem?** What are the obstacles you will face in trying to tackle this problem? What is your approach? Why is it different than what others have tried?
5. **Why should others think you will succeed?** What evidence do you have that you will succeed? What kind of track record do you have? Do you have early results that suggest it will be a promising approach?

## Exercise 3: The Slide

Your slide ought to communicate at most three ideas. That is, when a person looks at your slide, it should evoke no more than three sentences in their head. These sentences might be sentences (ideally phrases) that they read, or maybe they are sentences that they formulate by looking at a picture or a graph. 

Remember that a person only gets 30 seconds to look at your slide, and while they are doing it, you are busy talking away. This can be very distracting if the slide is not exactly on point with what you are saying.

This will mainly be an in-class activity.
