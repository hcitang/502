# Interim Report

You've now completed the first half of the course. It is time to reflect on the progress that has been made, and to articulate what the anticipated work.

In research, it is common to receive funding from a funding agency (e.g. NSERC, Microsoft, etc.) that will ask, "Hey, what have you done with our money?" Sometimes, they ask for such a report to make sure that money is being used effectively (after receipt of which, they will send you the second half of the money you asked for); other times, it feels like a report that will basically get filed away and unread (awaiting, presumably, some kind of audit). For the sake of this class, we are going to pretend that it is the first kind. ;-)

## Learning Goals/Objectives

1. Reconsider and reframe the research problem/question based on your (now more sophisticated) understanding of the problem space.
2. Rearticulate the framing of your research based on feedback that you have received.
3. Take another pass synthesizing the related work section of your work.
4. Articulate the steps that have been taken (and their research value).
5. Provide a more realistic articulation of the timeline.

## Deliverable

Submit two PDF files. The first PDF file will be your report (in the same template as you used in the proposal phase), and the second PDF file should be a report on what has changed since your proposal. This second file can be a bullet point list, but be sure to call out differences so that we know what to look for.

## How to Write an Interim Report

You are encouraged to reuse passages from your already-written [proposal](proposal.md), though _please_ take the time to ensure that the text is updated (at the very least) in terms of the tense.

As you prepare this report, consider carefully everything that you now know about your research problem and solution (that is, you should be more sophisticated in terms of your understanding of what needs to be done, the challenges, and so forth). Take this understanding, and do not be afraid to rearticulate (from scratch, even!) the problem. Maybe, for instance, what you were working on before was based on poor assumptions, or your project has been far more narrow, etc. Take this into account when you revise the major sections of your report.

You may want to consider reframing your work (i.e. related work) given that you have probably read more about the problem space.

Next, articulate what you have done to this point, and any challenges that you have encountered. Outline what you will do to address these challenges (or call them out so that your supervisor knows what s/he needs to address with you moving forward).

Finally, provide a timeline for the remaining work. Do not forget to have class deliverables in that list.

## Major Sections

Lots of different ways to structure this report, but here are two ways:

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Related Work
4. Work to date
5. Challenges
6. Proposed work / Timeline
7. References

And another: 

1. Abstract
2. Introduction/Motivation
3. Basic definitions/Explanation of the problem
4. Proposed solution to problem
5. Related work
6. Intended evaluation of proposed solution
7. Conclusion
8. Bibliography

Because each project is fundamentally different, it is difficult to provide "one-size-fits-all" advice here. If you are uncertain, please do not hesitate to ask me or your supervisor for advice.
